  <p>Welcome to the Austin (Texas) History Center’s Cemetery Database, a listing of burials dating from 1866 to 1921. Most of the interments represented in this database are for the Oakwood Cemetery, Austin’s oldest public cemetery located at 1601 Navasota Street. In addition to Oakwood internments, some burials at Mount Calvary, Oakwood Annex, and the Texas State Cemetery are represented.  The names included in this database were extracted from the original cemetery ledgers that are archived at the Austin History Center. The Austin History Center appreciates the work of the Austin Genealogical Society in transcribing the data.</p>
  <p>The Austin History Center, in an effort to reduce harm and improve search functionality, has updated or removed outdated, harmful, and unclear terminology where possible. The following areas of the database feature archivist-supplied description: ledger column headings denoting place of birth, nationality, cause of death, and race and ethnicity; outdated or derogatory terms used for race or ethnicity of a decedent; and standardizing references to the Oakwood Historic “Colored Grounds.” Please be aware that in some cases decisions were made not to remove/replace outdated language because our current understanding of some historic terminology may be inaccurate and changing language may cause the information to be historically incorrect. This is most notable in the “Cause of Death” column where the language reflects the society in which the ledgers were created. <a href="/ahc/austin-history-center-cemeteries">More information and context about decisions made concerning language in this database may be found here</a>.</p>
  <p>The cemetery ledgers are available for viewing at The Austin History Center, and preserve the original, descriptive language used by the historical subjects who authored the content.  Information about accessing the original ledgers and other information regarding the Oakwood Cemetery, and other City-owned cemeteries, including maps, clippings, and photographs is available in the Guide to the Collection. The original version of this database is also available upon request.</p>
  <p>We embrace ongoing conversations about inclusive language and welcome your feedback. This is a large database and despite our best efforts, you may encounter harmful, offensive, or outdated language. If you encounter such language, or have other questions or comments, <a href="/ahc/cemeteries-contact">please report your concern here</a>.</p>
