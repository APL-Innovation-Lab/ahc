7729561,1,/ahc/austin-history-center-cemeteries,Austin History Center Cemeteries Database notes,"<p id=""introduction"">The Austin History Center considers the Austin History Center Cemeteries Database to be a search &amp; access tool (public knowledge space) and not a verbatim transcription of the ledger. The original ledgers are available for research at the Austin History Center. The long-term goal of the Austin Parks and Recreation Department (PARD) is to scan the ledgers and make them available online. In addition, the PARD Cemeteries Division is working on verifying all internment information and creating a new City of Austin Cemetery database starting with Oakwood Cemetery. The cemeteries database maintained and updated by PARD will eventually replace the AHC version of the database except for the Mount Calvary Cemetery information.</p>\n\n<p>AHC goals for the existing Cemeteries Database are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>to reduce harm whenever possible by updating language and providing context when historical language needs to be retained</li>\n	<li>create a more navigable tool for the average researcher that doesn’t require extensive knowledge of historical language to have a successful search experience</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=""informing-our-work"">Informing our work:<br />\n<a href=""https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf"">A4BLiP Anti-Racist Description Resources</a><em> Handling Racist Folder Titles and Creator-Sourced Description</em> section<br />\nWright, Kirsten. “Archival interventions and the language we use.” Archival Science (2019): 1-18.</p>\n\n<p id=""race-ethnicity""><strong>Race/ethnicity</strong> - This column was referred to as “Color” in the original cemetery ledgers. We use the terminology “Race/Ethnicity” instead as it better describes, identifies, and categorizes individuals according to a shared history, culture, external characteristics, language, nationality, and other identity markers. To repair harmful and offensive language contained in the original document we use terms within this column that are preferred by the contemporary community and descendants of those referenced in the original source documents. We also chose to use language that is considered respectful and conventional in twenty-first century communities and public records.</p>\n\n<p id=""sex""><strong>Sex</strong> – The column labeled “Sex” uses the original designations of “F” (female) and “M” (male) which were used by creators to describe an interred individual’s biological sex.</p>\n\n<p id=""place-of-birth""><strong>Place of Birth</strong> – referred to as ""Nativity"" in the original cemetery ledgers and includes country, state, county, and city names as understood by the cemetery employees at the time the information was recorded. Efforts have been made to update abbreviations for a more consistent searching experience and derogatory terms for a person's place of birth have been updated with contemporary place names. Historic place names for countries (i.e., Prussia) have been maintained. Also, be aware that borders are not fixed throughout history and the country names listed in the database are to be understood in historical context.</p>\n\n<p id=""cause-of-death""><strong>Cause of Death</strong> – referred to as ""Disease"" in the original cemetery ledgers and was renamed to better reflect the information recorded by the cemetery employees. In 1903, the State Department of Public Health and Vital Statistics began requiring the registration of deaths. Before then, physicians were not mandated to record the key pieces of information found in a modern death certificate: the cause, mechanism, and manner of a death. For example, physicians sometimes recorded suicide as the cause as opposed to the manner of death, or they omitted that a murderer inflicted the traumatic injury that caused a person’s death. Moreover, 19th-early 20th century physicians relied partially on demographic information to determine cause of death, i.e. assigned sex, race, age, heredity, habits, and adjudged mental health at the time of death. Stigmatized “causes” of death listed in the city cemetery ledger include dissipation, insanity, lunacy, several types of mania, and nervous exhaustion or prostration. Such diagnoses do not have present-day counterparts and must be viewed with a critical lens.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, “cause of death” was a racialized category during Reconstruction and the decades following it. Almost all individuals whose cause of death was described as executions were African American males, and due to poor recordkeeping, researchers must do due diligence to determine whether they were judicial or extrajudicial killings. Relatedly, people of color who were suspects or convicted murderers of individuals listed in the ledger are mentioned by their race alone as opposed to their names. This pattern of racialized language when recording cause of death should also be considered when judging the validity of information provided regarding how individuals of color died.</p>\n\n<p id=""where-buried""><strong>Where Buried</strong> – Most of the historic language was retained because our current understanding of cemetery or section names may not be the same as what the cemetery employees were referencing at the time the information was recorded. The one exception is the language used to refer to the historic African American section of the Oakwood Cemetery. The Parks and Recreation Oakwood Cemeteries staff conducted significant research and held community engagement sessions and an agreement was made to name this section of the cemetery the Historic “Colored Grounds”. As a result, references to ""Negro Grounds"", ""Negro Grave Yard"", ""Negro Burial Grounds"", and ""Negro Cemetery"" in the database were all updated to Historic ""Colored Grounds"" to be in line with the Parks and Recreation Department's name for the historic African American section of Oakwood Cemetery. Abbreviations were spelled out to facilitate a more consistent searching experience.</p>\n\n<p>Some people listed in the ledger were buried in the Austin State Hospital (ASH) Cemetery or examined by ASH physicians. In the 19th century, ASH accepted people with dementia, epilepsy, tuberculosis, and other disabilities until additional institutions were built to accommodate specific conditions. Just because an individual was buried at the ASH Cemetery or examined by one of their physicians does not mean that they had mental illnesses. Using records like periodicals, family papers, and probate records can reveal more about the context surrounding the deaths of people identified in this ledger.</p>",,,,English,1701781021,,,

746081,1,/ahc/hidden-austin-stories-original-square,Hidden Austin: Stories From the Original Square Mile,"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Austin was first laid out on 640 acres, one square mile, on the Colorado River in 1839. It was a somewhat odd place for the capital city as it skirted what was Comanche and Apache territory immediately to the west and was also far from Galveston, which was the largest city in Texas at the time. It took days over rough and rutted dirt roads to reach the city from the most populace areas of the state. For a time, there was tension among factions of Texans who wanted to move the capital back to the coast. Tension&nbsp;over the location wasn't resolved until&nbsp;the capital had moved to Houston, then to Washington-on-the-Brazos for a time,&nbsp;and then finally back to Austin in 1845. It was not until a vote in 1872 that Austin was designated the permanent capital and its fate sealed.</p>\n\n<p>Much has happened on the original square mile since 1839; some of the history is known or revealed in the historic structures and markers left behind. But countless stories are hidden, and you would have no idea the event happened on the site. There are stories of murder, politics gone wrong, community resilience, business acumen – stories of people great and small that all have an impact on Austin’s story. The AHC uncovered and offer 13 ""hidden"" stories about Austin, stories that reverberate today but have no physical remnant on the sites in which they occurred.</p>\n\n<h2 style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.vamonde.com/adventure/hidden-austin-stories-from-the-original-square-mile/1548/"" target=""blank""><img alt="""" src=""/library/u28429/hidden-austin-vamonde-logo.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 153px;"" /></a><br />\n<a href=""https://www.vamonde.com/adventure/hidden-austin-stories-from-the-original-square-mile/1548/"" target=""_blank"">Click here to view with all 13&nbsp;stories in our Vamonde app</a></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=""text-align:center"">Or watch individual stories from Hidden Austin in the video playlist below</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<center><iframe align=""middle"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLLOCh82GaeUne-hmSlD5Jcp0zqtgBGKYr"" width=""560""></iframe>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</center>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,http://library.austintexas.gov/library/hidden-austin-logo-landing-page-580px-w-green.jpg,Hidden Austin: Stories From the Original Square Mile,English,1701779309,,,

The photographs document the people, events, businesses, and organizations in the African American community in Austin and Texas during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Of particular interest are the large number of photographs that feature individuals active in the social, business, religious, and political life of the African American community in Austin, especially East Austin, and Texas. African American business owners, community leaders, and activists are represented as well as many black and Hispanic politicians who sought the coveted <i>Villager </i>endorsement in local races. <a href=""http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aushc/00003/ahc-00003.html"" target=""_blank"">The full collection</a> is available to view in the <a href=""https://library.austintexas.gov/ahc/visit-us"" target=""_blank"">Austin History Center Reading Room</a>, along with issues of <i>The Villager</i> dating back to 1973.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=""color:#333333"">Join us for the opening reception of the exhibit on January 30, 2020 from 6:30-8:00 pm.

During the spring 2019 semester, Joseph Vitone, Professor of Photography and Media Arts, led the “City of Austin Documentary Photography Project” course (PHCO-3322.01) where students chose documentary subjects in the Austin/Travis County area. As city documentarians, the students learned how to create visually engaging and intellectually challenging stories of the people and places of Austin, Texas, as well as developed interview skills with their human subjects to write compelling captions.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership resulted in the St. Edward's University Austin Documentary Photography Project Collection (AR.2019.026), consisting primarily of digital photographs documenting various facets of the Austin area community as selected by the student photographers. In addition to the photographs, project statements from each of the photographers summarize their experience interviewing and documenting their subjects of interest. Themes represented in the photographs include housing and urban development, particularly on Burnet Road, changing demographics, arts and culture, funerary practices including natural burial, and youth addiction recovery. Photographs not on exhibit are available for viewing in the AHC’s Reading Room during open hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Projects</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Project 1: How Austin Worships, Photographer: Ariah Alba</li>\n	<li>Project 2: Funeral Services in Austin, TX, Photographer: Sabrina Amezcua</li>\n	<li>Project 3: Brewing Up Austin, Photographer: Brayden Armstrong</li>\n	<li>Project 4: How Austin Eats, Photographs by Cassidie Cox</li>\n	<li>Project 5: The Facades and Development of Burnet Rd., Photographs by Ryan Cunningham</li>\n	<li>Project 6: Small Theaters in Austin, Texas, Photographs by Kaitlyn Dawson</li>\n	<li>Project 7: Exposed, Photographs by Deniz Girismen</li>\n	<li>Project 8: Limestone, Photographs by Joey Hadden</li>\n	<li>Project 9: Youth Recovery in Austin, Texas, Photographs by Ashley McGrain</li>\n	<li>Project 10: Burnet Development, Photographs by Sean Pierce</li>\n	<li>Project 11: Film and the Ritz, Photographs by Mauro Ruiz</li>\n	<li>Project 12: New Austin, Photographs by Anna Skelley</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,English,1701780299,,,

Since 1973, everyday Austinites have had the resources to create their own TV programs. While in production on ""When We Were Live"", a feature documentary about the history of Austin Public Access Television, filmmaker John Spottswood Moore worked with the Austin History Center in building a catalog of hundreds of these access programs. From Banana-themed Drag queens to Spanish language educational programs to late night call-in shows, these tapes provide an extremely unique document of the diversity and evolution of our town over the last 5 decades.</p>\n\n<p>The Austin History Center and When We Were Live invite you to attend an afternoon of nostalgia and fun at Our Town on TV. Come see access TV the way it was meant to be viewed! Multiple vintage television sets will be set up, with each set playing its own themed loop of footage from the Austin History Center's Public Access Community Television Records and Video Collection (AR.2007.015). Featured footage highlights will include the music scene, local activism, LGBTQ issues, and ""Old Austin"".</p>\n\n<p>The event is free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be served. Newly designed posters for ""When We Were Live"" by Austin artists Matthew Stavrowsky and JP Pfertner will be available for purchase.</p>\n\n<p>As the local history division of the Austin Public Library, the Austin History Center provides the public with information about the history, current events and activities of Austin and Travis County. The Center collects and preserves information about local governments, businesses, residents, institutions, and neighborhoods so that generations to come will have access to their history.</p>\n\n<p>This event is supported in part by the Cultural Arts Division of the City of Austin Economic Development Department.</p>",,,,English,1701778825,,,

Her work has been featured in many national and international publications including <em>The&nbsp;New Yorker</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>Austin Chronicle</em>, <em>Austin American Statesman</em>, and <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout her years as a working photographer, Cindy maintained a close professional relationship with several local Austin bands, especially the Joe Ely Band, photographing them regularly. Though he hails from Lubbock and remains part of a close group of Lubbock musicians, most notably Butch Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore with whom he performs as The Flatlanders, Joe Ely has been a mainstay and icon of the Austin music scene since the late 1970s. His music spans genres, happily occupying a space somewhere between blues, Tejano, honky-tonk, and rock ‘n roll.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The photos in this exhibit span 1986-1990 and primarily feature guitarist David Grissom, bassist Jimmy Pettit, and drummer Davis McLarty who represent Ely’s late 1980s – early 1990s heyday. Also onstage in several photos are guitarist Jesse “Guitar” Taylor, saxophonist Bobby Keys, steel guitar player Lloyd Maines, and Texas BBQ legend Christopher B. “Stubb” Stubblefield of Stubb’s BBQ fame, all native Lubbockians. Playing at bygone landmarks such as the Austin Opera House and Liberty Lunch, the photographs represent an era in Austin’s music history that is emblematic of the city’s reputation as a live music mecca.</p>\n\n<p>Join us for <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/2459501304298163/"" target=""_blank"">the opening reception</a> of the exhibit on July 30 from 6:30-8:30 pm.

These families have made great contributions to Austin’s cultural and professional landscape while paving the way for future immigrant families and Chinese American community. Early Chinese immigration to Texas was often slow and stilted, primarily due to anti-Asian policies such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Yet a small number of Chinese people made their way to Austin in the late 1800s. According to the 1875 Austin Census, there were 20 Chinese people living in Austin. Many these were male laborers formerly engaged in railroad construction in California and Mexico.</p>\n\n<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt"">In Austin, most of the early Chinese families practiced service-oriented work in environments such as restaurants, groceries and laundromats. The 1943 abolition of the Chinese Exclusion Act coupled with future immigration policy such as the 1965 Immigration Act, caused the Chinese population in Travis County to jump from 94 in the 1960s to 332 in the 1970s. Today, Asian Americans in Austin are the fastest growing demographic in the city, making up nearly 8% of Austin’s population. Austin’s Chinese population comprises 19.9% of the city’s Asian population. Austin’s Chinese Americans are small business owners, social workers, health care professionals, activists, software engineers, service industry workers, caretakers and much more.</p>\n\n<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt"">These photographs from the Austin History Center’s Asian American archives provide an intimate look into the lives of the Lung, Ng, Sing, Tu and Wong families. <i>Pioneers from the East </i>was originally an Austin History Center photo exhibit curated by the inaugural Asian America Community Archivist, Esther Chung Martin, and opened to the public on October 17, 2010.

This May, volunteer your time to&nbsp;transcribe an oral history of a local AAPI community member from the Asian American Community Archives. Transcriptions provide a verbatim guide to the oral history, reflecting the actual speech of the interviewer and interviewee. Written transcriptions are essential to making oral histories searchable on internet search databases such as Google. This makes transcriptions extremely valuable to researchers and are an important archival preservation practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it work?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Transcribe remotely from your home or work! The Austin History Center will provide you with a Google Folder containing the oral history recording, a biographical sketch, transcription best practices and oral history style guides to aid you as you work. Most oral histories in this collection are 60 – 90 minutes in length which can require up to 6 hours of transcription work. Not only will you have the opportunity to hear a first-person narrative about your city’s local AAPI history, but your transcription will help create a more robust and accessible Asian American oral history archive for the City of Austin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interested in participating? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Complete this form and we will connect you with your oral history recording: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSer4QzO5yRRtePodJ1F2gpKywnE2yh6DuNHcVT4_ZaaYSq2Og/viewform</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Contact Asian American Archivist Ayshea Khan at ayshea.khan@austintexas.gov.</p>\n\n<p>To listen previously recorded oral histories from the Austin History Center, visit our <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/austinhistorycenter"">Soundcloud Page</a>!</p>\n\n<p><i>The Austin History Center’s Asian American Community Archivist Program actively collects archival materials from AAPI communities in Austin and Travis County through outreach efforts and programming.

Teachers, students, and parents were encouraged to tune in each week to engage in a series of thirty 15-minute educational broadcasts programmed through Radio House at the University of Texas at Austin. Topics ranged from receiving immunizations, balanced diets, fire prevention, and rat control to knowing your doctor and maintaining proper mental health.</p>\n\n<p>The photographs were taken by Willis R. Bodine, a consultant from the Division of Extension who conducted in-person trainings, interviews, and site visits throughout the duration of the radio program.

A collaborative project between the Travis County rural school districts, the Bureau of Research in Education by Radio, and twenty-one cooperating state, local and community agencies, <i>Healthy Living in Our County</i> served as a model for neighboring school districts.

A temporary platform was erected, around which crowds gathered to witness ceremonies marking the end of the streetcar era in Austin. The streetcar had been traveling through the very intersection that people were crowded into for 65 years. From 1875 - 1940 the streetcars were fundamental to Austin’s landscape, shaping the city they operated in by driving people’s decisions of where to live and work, serving as a battleground for racial conflict, and influencing city transportation policies.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span new="""" roman="""" style=""font-family:"" times="""">A ubiquitous feature of the city since the first mules pulled their cargo of passengers past the wagons and trolleys on the dirt lanes of Austin as a frontier town before electricity powered them across a city crowded with automobiles. The streetcars rolled across the city as a symbol of Austin’s growth, bearing more than witness to her development but playing a critical role in it as well. The routes of their tracks drove more than passengers. From Hyde Park to Travis Heights and from Lake Austin to East Austin, residential development across the city can trace its roots to the streetcar lines. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span new="""" roman="""" style=""font-family:"" times="""">Archival material gathered from the collections of the Austin History Center illustrate this ubiquitous nature.

In some cases they may even discover striking similarities to events that happened nearly 100 years previously, such as when the streetcars went to war with the Jitneys in 1915. The prospect of an electric light rail might seem like a modern concern, but the story of the streetcar proves otherwise. It is a story that demonstrates how such mass transit was once employed in the City and the way that its network integrated it into the fabric of Austin. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p>Click on the thumbnails below to see some sample images from the exhibit.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,English,1701778916,,,

[AR.1997.001(002)] Susette Meyer Papers.</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The U. S. entered WWI in April 1917 after staying out for nearly three years. Of the 4 million Americans that eventually became a part of the military effort, almost 200, 000 men and approximately 450 women were from Texas –roughly 4% of the Texas population at the time*. Consequently, it would have been common in many Texas homes to have a picture on display of someone in the military. So many took on new roles in the military effort that the impact was felt across the state. Austin was no different. Over 5000 Texans died, with at least 30 or more from Austin killed fighting in France or dying in the flu epidemic that swept through military training camps.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, hidden behind the staggering statistics and complicated politics of the First World War are the lives and deaths of individuals, most of them quite young, and most of them imagining something far different for their future besides war. Those lives tend to be lumped together into numbers that fail to account for the more significant fact that each one of them had a name, a family, friends and a community from which they drew a personal sense of what mattered. Whether the war itself mattered to them is difficult to know. But at the same time, just as it would be for any of us, it was their relationships which distinguished who they were and why they went.</p>\n\n<p>By now, most of those proud, young faces have disappeared from the mantelpiece, but a few ended up in this archive on the chance that someone will come looking, hoping to see them again. Such is the value of archives – keeping forgotten faces and forgotten stories safe until another seeks to know the people and events that made their world.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the historical record is such that it is always fragmentary. There are holes in our knowledge of what happened that no amount of statistics can fill. When it comes to the experiences of individuals, we are left to span those spaces with interpretation and even imagination. Even so, a few individual faces, along with a few facts about them, can begin to frame our own sense of what happened one hundred years ago. When set into the broader context of a worldwide conflict that took 16 million lives and wounded our world to a depth historians are still trying to calculate, the faces in this exhibit are an opportunity to behold a war fought by persons, individual citizens, who bore the immense burden of it all. Some were ruined by the war completely. Others lived with the memory of it into old age. And while most of their individual stories have been forgotten, we can still ask what the war made of them even as we ask that of ourselves. This exhibit hopes that addressing the loss of so many individual stories might be a source for meaningful reflection on their war, the Great War, great if only because it remains our war as well.</p>\n\n<p>Click on the thumbnails below to see some sample images from the exhibit.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,English,1701780544,,,

The 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City brought a spotlight to injustices against LGBTQ communities, and the following decades ushered in a fight for LGBTQ rights and visibility.</p>\n\n<p>The number of out, or openly gay, performers in Austin’s local music scene by the 1980s was growing, with nationally recognized punk musicians such as Gary Floyd of the Dicks and Randy “Biscuit” Turner of the Big Boys. Masculinity was deep-seated within the hardcore punk scene, and few punk musicians were openly gay. Along with the underrepresentation of LGBTQ-identifying musicians, as lesbian singer-songwriter Gretchen Phillips points out, very few rock bands were female-led.</p>\n\n<p>The boldness of Floyd and Turner encouraged Phillips to create politically charged and sexually frank music in female-fronted queer bands. The openness about sexuality from a lesbian perspective was arguably the beginning of the Riot Grrrl movement, which gave a platform for feminism in the punk rock scene. Phillips formed multiple lezzie rock bands, including Meat Joy, Two Nice Girls, Girls in the Nose, Lord Douglass Phillips, and The Gretchen Phillips Xperience. Other notable women in the lesbian music community included Darcee Douglass, Terri Lord, Meg Hentges, and Kay Turner, who played in various bands including Power Snatch, Sincola, and Swine King. The genres of these bands ranged from folk to experimental to funk, but at the core was the punk ethos of nonconformity and individuality.</p>\n\n<p>Sandra Martinez opened Chances in the 1980s, widely remembered as a legendary lesbian bar and punk performance space. Frequented by men, women, straight, and LGBTQ people, Chances became a regular gathering place for benefits and political activism as much as for live music and drinks. While gay and lesbian bars of the 1970s existed in the backs of establishments and hidden from public view, Martinez decided in 1986 to take down coverings from the windows and give greater visibility and openness to the bar as well as to the LGBTQ community who patronized it.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa Davis, a local photographer, was friends with several musicians who frequently played at Chances and other Austin venues, and she documented numerous bands, queer and straight, over her short lifetime. Davis was equally engaged in activism, as many within the music community were, and took part in protests with the Women’s Action Coalition and the Lesbian Avengers, organizations which voiced their messages against homophobia and misogyny through demonstrations and performance art.</p>\n\n<p><b>We’ll Just Rock for Ourselves</b> presents photographs from the Lisa Davis Photograph Archive (AR.2011.022) that document the lesbian musicians and LGBTQ activists of the 1990s. The title is taken from a Power Snatch song titled “No Thanks (We’ll Just Rock For Ourselves),” which was written in response to the song “Intellectuals Rocking for Women” by the all-male band the Pocket FishRmen.</p>\n\n<p>Davis was a prolific photojournalist and her archive contains over 29,000 images, taken largely between 1978 and 1995. She documented everything from live music to the first 100 days of Ann Richards’ term as Governor to local high school sports. Her photography was published in local and national magazines and newspapers including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>OUT Magazine</i>, and <i>The Austin Chronicle</i>. <span style=""background:white"">After battling major depression, Davis took her own life on July 14, 1995, at the age of 32. A memorial service was held for her in Austin at Umlauf Sculpture Gardens, and friends and members of the community gave donations in her memory to Out Youth, an organization founded in 1990 that serves Central Texas LGBTQ youth and their allies.</span></p>\n\n<p>To see more images from the Lisa Davis Photograph Archive, visitors can come to the Austin History Center during open hours: Tuesday-Saturday, 10-6 and Sunday 12-6. <a href=""http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aushc/00615/ahc-00615.html"">An inventory of the collection is available online.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Click on the thumbnails below to see some sample images from the exhibit.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,English,1701776741,,,

Arthur Fehr (1904-1969) earned his architecture degree in 1925 from the University of Texas and went on to graduate study at Columbia University, Beaux Arts Institute of Design and New York University. Charles Granger (1913-1966) was an architectural student at the University of Texas when he was hired as a summer intern by Arthur Fehr. After graduation in 1936, he worked for the influential architect, Richard Neutra in Los Angeles, then earned a master’s degree from Cranbrook Academy in Michigan, where he worked as a designer for the famed Eliel Saarinen. After Fehr’s extensive travel and study in Europe, he and Mr. Granger opened their Austin partnership in 1946. Working in a Modernist style, the next two decades were highly productive for the esteemed firm. Winning numerous awards, they created projects that include residential, commercial, educational and ecclesiastical designs throughout central Texas. Mr. Fehr was made a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1957. Charles Granger was killed in an automobile accident in 1966 shortly after becoming a fellow to the American Institute of Architects. Arthur Fehr continued to practice under the firm name Fehr and Granger until his death in 1969. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:106%""><span arial="""" style=""font-family:"">Click on the thumbnails below to see some images, or view our <a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-mid-century-architects-381675"">companion web exhibit</a>.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,English,1701779535,,,

397261,1,/ahc/dewey-g-mears-photograph-archive,Dewey G. Mears Photograph Archive,"<p>Dewey Mears was the preeminent architectural photographer in Central Texas in the late 20th century. Originally from Lamesa, Texas, Mears began his interest in photography as a teenager. He studied in Lubbock, opened his own studio in Levelland, and was an official US Army photographer during World War II at Camp Swift. After being discharged, Mears began his career in Austin, taking a variety of jobs, including advertising and event photography. By the mid-1950s he focused his efforts on architectural documentation. Mears reproduced renderings and drawings, photographed building construction, and documented finished buildings, especially buildings in the celebrated mid-century modern style. Among the architectural firms represented in the collection are Jessen Jessen Millhouse &amp; Greeven, Fehr &amp; Granger, Kuehne Brooks &amp; Barr, and Page Southerland Page, among many others. Prominent buildings pictured include Austin’s Municipal Auditorium, the Flawn Academic Center at the University of Texas, the Commodore Perry Hotel, the Driskill Hotel, and Villa Capri restaurant and hotel. In 1955 he became president of the Austin Photographers Guild and in 1956 received his Master’s Degree from the Photographers’ Association of America. In 1965 he became president of the Texas Professional Photographers Association and during his tenure he began their magazine, the <i>Texas Professional Photographer</i>. Over the years he earned 17 trophies from the Austin Guild and the TPPA.</p>\n\n<p>Donated by Mears’ family to the AHC in 2014, the collection has remained completely inaccessible to researchers until now. With funding from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services through the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, AHC staff have cataloged about 40,000 negatives.

The building, situated on the highest point of the St. Stephen's Episcopal School campus, was conceived as a natural outgrowth of the terrain and climate and stands today as&nbsp;the physical and spiritual center of the school.

The population of Austin grew from 87,900 in 1940 to 214,117 by 1965. With careful regard for style, the Fehr and Granger firm contributed a number of residential properties during those decades, including their own houses. New building methods allowed for open floor plans giving a larger feel to rooms that flowed from one to the next. With changes in sheet glass production, large window walls were possible allowing a direct connection between the interior and exterior. Understated designs made with the best available natural materials, combined with fine workmanship, characterize the structures which still seem contemporary today.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=""Barclay House"" src=""/library/u13982/ar-2009-014-097b_0.jpg"" style=""float: left; width: 500px; height: 363px;"" /><br />\n<span style=""font-size:8.0pt""><span>Barclay House, 1958, AR-2009-014-097, Photograph by Dewey Mears</span></span></p>\n\n<h3>Barclay House</h3>\n\n<p>A good example of Mid-Century design, the Mr. and Mrs. James N. Barclay Residence was completed in 1956. The single-slope roof lends itself well to the open flow of the interior spaces. With its combination of clerestory and jalousie windows, the design strives for a pure unadorned sense of line. In combination with the exterior walls, walkway, landscaping and entry landing, the total effect creates a pattern of rich texture and sculptural form inside and out. Not only a visual element, the louvered windows allow air flow, an important aspect of Mid-Century Modern architectural philosophy. Another aspect of the ethos of modernist design is the use of local building materials such as the stone used to make the&nbsp;exterior walls.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=""Sneed House"" src=""/library/u13982/ar-2009-014-245.jpg"" style=""float: right; width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /><br />\n<span style=""font-size:8.0pt""><span>Sneed House,&nbsp;AR-2009-014-243, Photograph by Dewey Mears</span></span></p>\n\n<h3>Sneed House</h3>\n\n<p>Extensive use of sliding glass panels and walls allow light in and create a connection to the outdoors in the Sneed residence, located at 3714 Meredith Street, Austin, Texas. The open living area with a fireplace in the center is a flexible common space with cork flooring and exposed ceiling beams. Completed in 1953, the house won a Texas Society of Architects award of merit for design. The house was built for University of Texas Professor, Joseph Sneed, and his wife, artist, Madelon Juergens Sneed. They moved away from Austin later in the decade.

With origins in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, American architects of the style included Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Philip Johnson. Elements of International style expressed in the Darnall house are; cantilevered rectilinear forms, generous use of glass and steel, surfaces without ornamentation, and horizontal bands of casement windows. The low-slung flat roof and blocky form are also typical of the style.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=""Breard House"" src=""/library/u13982/ar-2009-014-093.jpg"" style=""float: right; width: 500px; height: 344px;"" /><br />\n<span style=""font-size: 8pt;"">Breard House,&nbsp;AR-2009-014-093, Photograph by Gottscho-Schleisner</span></p>\n\n<h3>Breard House</h3>\n\n<p>Featured in Progressive Architecture in 1953, the Breard Residence in Dallas, Texas was designed to require a minimum of housework and to cut down on dust and pollen due to the family’s allergies. All furnishings were special ordered by the architects with the family only bringing essentials such as clothing, dishes and books. The house was designed with bedrooms and baths in one unit and living and dining areas in another wing, linked with a central entryway. Charles Granger said that owners Mr. and Mrs. Jack Breard ""knew, in general, their space requirements and simply advised us that they wanted us to design a house to fill those space needs.""</p>\n\n<p><a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-mid-century-architects"">Home</a> | <a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-residential"">Residential</a>&nbsp;| <a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-commercial-work"">Commercial</a> |<a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-educational"">&nbsp;Educational</a> |&nbsp;<a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-ecclesiastical-work"">Ecclesiastical</a> |&nbsp;<a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-bastrop-state-park"">Bastrop Park</a>&nbsp;| <a href=""/ahc/fehr-and-granger-map-works"">Map</a> | <a href=""/ahc/fehr-granger-austin-history-center-resources"">Resources</a></p>",,http://library.austintexas.gov/library/fg-banner-960_2.jpg,Fehr and Granger logo,English,1712091613,,,

383752,1,/ahc/vietnam-austin-shattered-history,Vietnam to Austin: A Shattered History,"<p>It is believed that the history of Vietnam dates back over 4,000 years ago. Because of a thousand years of Chinese imperial domination, much of the Chinese governmental and societal structure was adopted. In the 19th century, European colonial rule and the influence of Buddhism and Christianity shaped the country; however, the Vietnamese still kept alive a vibrant culture and language of their own through poetry and folk traditions.</p>\n\n<p>France withdrew its colonial interests in 1954. Soon after, the United States began supporting the republican government of South Vietnam against the Communist government of North Vietnam. For the next 21 years, Vietnam became a contested battleground and on April 30, 1975, South Vietnam surrendered to the North after the Communist North Vietnamese Army took control of Saigon. The War in Vietnam had a tremendous human impact. American casualties are well documented: 2,500,000 Americans served, 58,135 Americans died in the war, 303,616 were wounded, and 35,000 American civilians were killed. But while Vietnamese statistics are far less exact, the war had a much larger impact on them. Over 1.9 million Vietnamese (North and South) died in the war, 3.2 million were wounded, and over 14 million lost their homes and became refugees. In South Vietnam alone, the war created 300,000 orphans and 131,000 widows. After the fall of Saigon until 1982, more than 1.2 million Vietnamese resettled in 16 countries, including the US. It is estimated that over a million of these immigrants left Vietnam by boat, called “Boat People,” and over 500,000 did not survive the trip.</p>\n\n<h3>Community Profile: Nancy Bui</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=""[Nancy Bui and children], undated, AR.2009.048 (156), "" austin:="""" community="""" restoring="""" to="""" vietnam="""" /></p>\n\n<p>[Nancy Bui and children], undated, AR.2009.048 (156), ""Vietnam to Austin: Restoring Community"" Exhibit Collection</p>\n\n<p>Nancy Bui was a journalist in Vietnam, a country she hardly recognized after the North Vietnamese&nbsp;won the war.

Winning numerous awards, they created inspiring projects that include residential, commercial, educational and ecclesiastical designs throughout central Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Fehr (1904-1969) earned his architecture degree in 1925 from the University of Texas and went on to graduate study at Columbia University, Beaux Arts Institute of Design and New York University. Charles Granger (1913-1966) was an architectural student at the University of Texas when he was hired as a summer intern by Arthur Fehr. After graduation in 1936, he worked for the influential modernist architect, Richard Neutra in Los Angeles, then earned a master’s degree from Cranbrook Academy in Michigan, where he worked as a designer for the famed Eliel Saarinen before returning to Austin, Texas. Mr. Fehr was made a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1957. Charles Granger was killed in an automobile accident in 1966 shortly after becoming a fellow to the American Institute of Architects. Arthur Fehr continued to practice under the firm name Fehr and Granger until his death in 1969.

An interest in providing a home to communities in need has a long history in Austin and Travis County. Whether serving as a temporary refuge for families displaced by war or natural disaster or engaging in activism to support the safe passage and resettlement of refugees around the world, Austin has provided space for new communities to flourish. Yet, refugees have also faced discrimination when claiming Austin as their new home. <i>Finding Refuge in Austin </i>considers how refugees in Austin have grappled with these challenges and worked to empower themselves and their communities. With Texas recently withdrawing from the federal Refugee Resettlement Program, this exhibit is timely, and also an important reminder of the historical roots and contributions of refugees in Austin and Travis County. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Image: AS-61-33161-01. <a href=""http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aushc/00442/ahc-00442.html"">Austin American Statesman Photo Morgue</a>, photo by and (c) Austin American Statesman.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px"">Click the thumbnail images below to view more from the exhibit.

The Austin Bicycle Club, formed in 1891, sponsored numerous parades, tournaments, races, and moonlight parties. One of the more popular events was the lantern parade, during which bicycles were decorated with Chinese lanterns. Women, as well as men, seemed to enjoy the sport.

In January 1846, Sam Stone opened the <strong>first ferry</strong> ""about one mile below Austin"" and promised travelers that ""…by crossing at this ferry, considerable distance is saved between Austin and San Antonio, and travellers will at the same time always be sure of a safe passage across."" Three other ferries, such as the one pictured, opened shortly after Stone's. By 1862, however, Captain James G.

In November 1869, the <strong>first bridge</strong>--known as the pontoon bridge--was completed at the foot of Brazos Street. The local newspapers described the accomplishment in glowing terms, but less than a year later the press reported that, after 36 hours of continuous rainfall, the pontoon bridge went ""glimmering to the Gulf.""<br />\n""No obstacles present themselves which have not been surmounted, and you now find the bank graded, and the pontoon bridge afloat, squarely anchored to two heavy English chains of superior workmanship and finish, stretched from shore to shore.

With no official record of the momentous occasion, the historian is sometimes left only with conflicting newspaper accounts, or hazy recollections, told years later by the surviving witnesses. The <strong>first automobile</strong>, which probably appeared in Austin around 1902, is a good example of this. Among the earliest owners were W.G. Bell, Pierre Bremond, Ewell Nalle, and Reinhold Haschke.

The selection of the site for the facility was a much simpler process in the 1920s than it is today. After searching all of Travis County, the site selection committee, composed of Chamber of Commerce Manager Walter Long and civic leaders Max Bickler and Julian Baldwin, settled on a 190-acre cotton field. Its major attraction was proximity to the already established Austin Air Service. After receiving federal approval, City Council voted to purchase the recommended site. Council sentiment, however, favored the purchase of only 80 of the 190 available acres. Councilmember Dave Reed, perhaps more enthusiastic about the future of aviation than his colleagues, persuaded the Council to approve purchase of the entire 190 acres. An additional 150 acres on which the City held an option was included later.</p>\n\n<p>""At that time the field had gravel runways and was equipped with a gasoline pump and a small office building on the northeast side. The agreement called for twenty-four hour service on the field. The major employee was Reagan B. Dickard, who was a pilot. Burck Smith was the other employee…The salaries ran on a monthly basis. The only profit was an occasional sale of a tank of gasoline. After a year's time and a $2,000 loss I resigned as manager."" John D.

The bridge itself is composed of 21 boats, at regular distance from each other, overlaid with heavy solid oak flooring, sawed expressly for that purpose, and securely laid, forming a tract of 10 feet in the clear; a pier of solid cottonwood stocks, notched and heavily bolted at the corners, stands on the opposite bank of the river, and filled in with rock to the height of some 12 or 14 feet, and seems as solid as the everlasting hills."" <i>Daily Austin Republican</i>, November 29, 1869.</p>\n\n	<p>""The work has been consummated, and the Colorado can now be crossed on the pontoon.

With no official record of the momentous occasion, the historian is sometimes left only with conflicting newspaper accounts, or hazy recollections, told years later by the surviving witnesses. The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first automobile</font></strong>, which probably appeared in Austin around 1902, is a good example of this. Among the earliest owners were W.G. Bell, Pierre Bremond, Ewell Nalle, and Reinhold Haschke.

The cheerful striped canvas awnings protected passengers from the elements while standing at 3rd and Congress. Inauspiciously, when the company's directors were taking an inaugural inspection tour and rounding the corner of Congress and 11th in front of the Capitol, the car left its tracks and turned over. Working with gravity, dignity took ten days to restore. There was a report on the Austin City Railroad after the first two days in operation.</p>\n\n	<p>""The receipts of the Austin City Railroad on Saturday and Sunday amounted to $116 - $43 on Saturday and $73 on Sunday. We understand that $20 a day pays all the incidental expenses of the road, so the flattering receipts of the first two business days of the road indicate that the enterprise will prove a paying investment�We look upon the Austin Street Railway as a great stimulator to the growth and prosperity of the city."" <i>Daily Democratic Statesman</i>, January 19, 1875.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Austin's <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first Municipal Airport</font></strong> was dedicated on October 14, 1930. The selection of the site for the facility was a much simpler process in the 1920s than it is today. After searching all of Travis County, the site selection committee, composed of Chamber of Commerce Manager Walter Long and civic leaders Max Bickler and Julian Baldwin, settled on a 190-acre cotton field. Its major attraction was proximity to the already established Austin Air Service. After receiving federal approval, City Council voted to purchase the recommended site. Council sentiment, however, favored the purchase of only 80 of the 190 available acres. Councilmember Dave Reed, perhaps more enthusiastic about the future of aviation than his colleagues, persuaded the Council to approve purchase of the entire 190 acres.

Austin's <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first traffic patrolman</font></strong>, Officer Kelley, came from Atlanta, Georgia in 1913, to help direct the growing number of automobiles passing through there. As traffic increased, Kelley used our <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first traffic light</font></strong>--a portable battery-powered light that he would bring out during rush hours. When the city got nine of its <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first automatic electric traffic signals</font></strong> in 1924, 6th and Congress was one of the first five intersections to receive one.</li>\n	<li>In the earliest years of our history, county legal business was conducted in a miscellany of available space around the city. The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first county courthouse</font></strong> was constructed in 1856 after the first county jail, a log structure, burned. For $23,000, a new stone building combining jail and courthouse functions was built on the site of the first jail. The site, just south of Republic Square on West Cedar (4th)--then the remote southwest corner of the city--was considered to be very inconveniently located, but it served until 1876 when the second courthouse was completed at Congress and Mesquite (11th).\n	<p>""...Every time a lawyer or litigant wants a subpoena issued, or a deed has to be recorded, or a marriage license obtained the party has to walk or borrow something to ride--a distance there and back of near half a mile; and the juror who happens to be entitled to the promise of a dollar and a half from the county for services rendered, in which he has probably spent seventy-five cents worth of shoe leather, had to go out of town to get the slip of paper containing said promise."" <i>The Southern Intelligencer</i>, November 9, 1865.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Until city voters approved the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first paid fire department</font></strong> in 1916, fires were fought by teams of volunteer fire departments. Austin Hook and Ladder Fire Company No. 1 was the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first volunteer company</font></strong>, organized in 1858. Hand-drawn fire carts and bucket brigades were used to fight the fires until horse-drawn wagons were acquired in 1870. After the election endorsing a municipal force of fire fighters, the volunteer companies sold their equipment and property to the city. Company No. 1's Fire Station on Hickory (8th)--on the right, next door to City Hall--became the city's <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first Central station</font></strong>. The first year's operating expenses of $43,740 was used to maintain a force of 27 firemen, five motor vehicles, and three horse-drawn vehicles.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The building that is now referred to as the ""old, old post office"" was the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first permanent home of the Austin Postal service</font></strong>. Until it was finished in 1880, the post office had offered its services from a series of rented spaces in office and retail buildings. This imposing $200,000 structure took ten years to build. The post office also housed federal courtrooms and the embezzlement trial of William Sydney Porter was held in one of them. This is the source of its present name--O. Henry Hall--given by its current owner, the University of Texas System.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Austin's <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first public hospital</font></strong> was built in 1884 on the northeastern-most lot of the City, an area which had been set aside for a hospital in the original city plan, probably to isolate sick Austinites from the healthy. For the city's first 45 years medical care was given either at home, or in one of a series of short-lived private infirmaries, or in ""pest camps"" set aside for those with contagious diseases. This City/County Hospital, the first public hospital in the state, was equipped to treat between 20 and 40 private or charity patients at one time. The cost of a private room ranged between $1.50 and $2.50 per day.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">beginning of Camp Mabry</font></strong> dates back to 1891, when a local citizens' committee was formed to select a permanent site for the annual encampments of the Texas Volunteer Guard (now the Texas National Guard). A 90-acre area three miles northwest of the capitol was chosen; by the summer of 1892 it was cleared and ready for use. Every summer thereafter, several thousand troops would arrive to train at Camp Mabry. The troops also staged sham battles, such as this one pictured, for the general public. Up to 10,000 visitors a year traveled to Austin to see these battles. Proceeds from the ticket sales in ensuing years allowed the Camp to acquire adjacent land which increased the size of the camp to over 400 acres.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first housing projects in the nation</font></strong> were built in Austin. In June 1939, the first of 186 families moved into three separate projects: the Santa Rita apartments (seen here on the left) for Mexican-Americans; the Rosewood project for Blacks; and the Chalmers project for whites. Rent and utilities for each family averaged $12.00 per month. Austin's application to build the projects was the first to arrive at the desk of the FHA in part through the influence of then Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Austin has been a city of readers since its founding; notices of subscription libraries date back to 1840. In 1894, however, William Sydney Porter (O. Henry) wrote, ""Time hangs heavy on my hands�for of all the cities I have ever lived in, Austin is the most deficient in opportunities for enjoying idle hours. There are no parks, museums, or art galleries--not even a public library."" It was 1926 before Mayor Wooldridge and the Austin Chapter of the American Association of University Women garnered enough citizen and city council support to start a public library. The library's first location was a rented room above 819 Congress Avenue; it was staffed by volunteers. A temporary wood structure was soon built on a lot across from Wooldridge Park. In 1929, the city budgeted $3,000 to operate the library and the voters approved a $150,000 bond issue to build the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first permanent library building</font></strong>. That 1933 building is now the Austin History Center; the temporary building was moved to east Austin and now serves as the Carver Museum.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Austin's <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first city-wide street lighting system</font></strong> was inaugurated in 1895, and was financed by the same bond package that paid for the Great Granite Dam and its municipal power house. Instead of installing a system of regular light poles, the city chose a favorable deal proposed by the Fort Wayne Power Company which used a system of 31 towers, each 165 feet high. The contract specified that a person would be able to read a watch within 1,500 feet of a tower. Although some backyard farmers at first feared the bright lights would keep the chickens up all night, the moonlight towers quickly became a source of civic pride.<br />\n	<a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101250636344114896750.0004612bdf2cf1a7d36a6&amp;ll=30.277155,-97.740555&amp;spn=0.051886,0.072956&amp;z=13&amp;source=embed"" style=""color: rgb(0,0,255); text-align: left"">Map of all Moonlight Tower locations</a></p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first paving of Congress Avenue</font></strong> in 1905 marked the transformation of ""old road and old ideas suited to a provincial village"" to the look of a cosmopolitan city.

It was one of four city blocks set aside in Edwin Waller's 1839 city plan as public squares. Original plans by civic groups calling for a terrace of artificial lakes did not materialize, and the chief improvement was the bandstand in the center. The topography lent itself to good acoustics for music, and it was promised that ""a very high class of music is assured for �summer concerts.""</p>\n\n	<p>""As yet no signs of 'keep off the grass' have been placed, and no policeman has been assigned to duty there to prevent spooning and there are fifty great big comfortable seats ready for occupancy."" <i>Austin Statesman</i>, June 16, 1909.</p>\n	</li>\n</ul>",,,,English,1701779394,,,

The experiment included the singing, from the St. Elmo end, of ""Almost Persuaded"" by a minister's daughter. On June 24, 1881, the <i>Statesman</i> reported 17 businesses with working telephones.

But it was also while in Austin that <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">O. Henry wrote his first story for national publication</font></strong>. ""The Miracle of Lava Canyon,"" written in 1897, was syndicated by S.S. McClure. The story was written at a Larkin drop front desk which is now a part of the Austin History Center's O.

Arriving in Texas in 1850, the Tinnins acquired approximately 500 acres on the southern bank of the Colorado River in the area which is now Travis Heights. In the 1850s female slaves used the machine to produce all of the clothes worn by the plantation's slaves. By 1860 the local newspaper advertised the opening of a ""sewing machine establishment"" on the corner of Mulberry (10th) and San Jacinto, but the first sewing machines were most commonly found among general hardware store merchandise.</li>\n	<li>Once ice was available in Austin, Austinites could experience their <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first taste of ice cream</font></strong>. On June 15, 1869, the Daily Austin Republican announced the opening of Charles W. Ohrndorf's Ice Cream Saloon on Congress Avenue, where ice cream and lemonade would be available ""at all hours of the day."" Indulging in the delectable sweet was not, however, a routine event. It was usually reserved for memorable social outings to be shared with friends, or a drawing card for celebrations such as the grand opening of Buaas Hall in 1871, where those who attended were promised ""ice creams of the most delicious flavors.""

The Austin Baseball Club--later renamed the Austin Senators--consisted of the entire team of professional players brought to Texas as the Joplin Independents by John McCloskey. In the fall of 1887 McCloskey's team defeated the New York Giants team which was touring Texas at that time. Originally scheduled as a three-game series, the twice-defeated Giants left town before the third game could be played. Baseball enthusiasts who witnessed the victory in Austin joined with McCloskey in organizing the Texas Baseball League and McCloskey's team became the Austin Club.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">University of Texas football team played its first game</font></strong> on Thanksgiving Day, 1893 at Fairground Park in Dallas. With no organized athletic program, the earliest competitions were held only when someone heard of another team who was willing to play. The Dallas Football Club players were known as the ""champions of Texas"" and were also reputed to be ""such a rough gang that none of the other town teams of the state were able to stand up to them."" U.T., however, won the game 18-16. By 1900, U.T had a band, the newly selected school colors were orange and white, and the football team was restricted to playing collegiate teams.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first golf club</font></strong> in Austin, later known as the Austin Country Club, was organized on November 13, 1899. Lewis Hancock, mayor from 1895 to 1897, is thought to have introduced the sport to Austinites. Hancock learned the game in New England where he vacationed with his family during the summer months in the 1890s.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>In 1913, long before the production crews of ""Outlaw Blues"" or ""Lonesome Dove"" arrived on the scene, Austinites W. Hope and Paul Tilley were busy trying to put Austin on the map as a major motion picture production location. The Tilley brothers' locally-based Satex Film Company produced several features in Texas and Mexico, including ""Their Lives by a Thread."" This film, probably the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first motion picture produced locally</font></strong>, was shot at the Austin Dam.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>The <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first porcelain bathtub</font></strong> thought to have been brought to Austin was the one installed in the West Sixth Street home of lumberman Edgar Nalle. The home was known for its elegant features, such as French chandeliers, which Nalle imported from throughout the world. On a trip to New York in the 1890s Nalle is said to have seen the bathtub, then in fashion, and had one sent by boat to Galveston. From Galveston, the bathtub completed its journey by train. When the house was demolished in the 1930s the tub was relocated in the nearby Smoot House.</p>\n\n	<p>""When the Nalle house was being torn down in the thirties, all of it was sold...well this bathtub was something no modern person wanted so the poor thing was thrown out into the weeds and was collecting rainwater...my mother looked at the poor bathtub and said what a pity such a handsome tub should not be taken and Mr. Edgar [Nalle] insisted that nobody wanted anything like that and mother said, 'Oh, what a shame. It certainly ought to have a home.' So Mr. Edgar begged her to take it but she wouldn't take it without paying him...and finally, just to settle things Mr. Edgar said, 'Well, if you'll just give me a dollar for each man it takes to lift it, I'll accept that."" It took ten men. Actually they needed more men but only ten could get around it to get a handhold on it and they had to strain and struggle because it is so heavy. But mother insisted on making it twenty dollars for the ten men and we have enjoyed it very much because, really, on a hot day, filling that with tap water, it's almost as good as Deep Eddy..."" Jane Smoot, in an interview with the Assistance League.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Austinites' long-term love affair with Barton Springs probably began with the area's first settlers--Native Americans who were attracted to the natural springs during the area's pre-history. A.M. Rumsey's 1882 depiction of Barton Springs colorfully illustrates Austinites enjoying the natural beauty of the picnicking and swimming spot. But it was not until 1917 that <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">Barton Springs became city property</font></strong>, when A.J. Zilker, the owner at that time, officially offered fifty acres of land to the City of Austin. In return, the City was to pay the Austin School District $10,000 per year for ten years, to benefit children through an endowment fund for manual training and domestic science. A similar transaction in 1931 added another 250 acres; Zilker's final donation of twenty-five acres was made shortly before his death in 1934. In 1933, <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">the area became Zilker Park</font></strong> when the City Council officially voted to name the park after Zilker and to keep the name Barton Springs for the swimming pool because that name had ""become widely known in Texas and the Southwest.""</p>\n\n	<p>""Barton Springs, some two miles west of the courthouse, burst forth in and near the creek of that name, about three-quarters of a mile above its mouth. There are three main springs...Ever since civilized men first saw this country and fell in love with its witching streams, they have attempted to conjecture their probable sources."" <i>Annals of Travis County</i>, Frank Brown [1875]</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Although Barton Springs had enjoyed a longer tradition as a recreational area, many early twentieth-century Austinites discovered that the amenities offered by Deep Eddy were more readily accessible: one could take the street car to Deep Eddy, but Barton Springs was ""way out in the country."" In 1916, owner A.J. Eilers developed the Deep Eddy area into a tourist resort which boasted the <strong><font face=""Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"" size=""2"">first open air concrete swimming pool</font></strong> in Texas. Visitors enjoyed water shows such as the one featuring the Great Lorena and her diving horses. In 1935, the City of Austin purchased Deep Eddy from Eilers. During that same year, a $25,000 construction project to erect a bath house began--the first WPA project to be started in Austin.</p>\n\n	<p>""In addition to the Colorado River, there is a large concrete natatorium, one hundred feet wide and two hundred feet long. This pool varies from a wading depth of one foot for the little folks to ten feet of water for the more expert swimmers and divers. Around the pool there are constructed various devices; such as slides, spring-boards, trapezes, flying rings, horizontal bars, diving towers, etc...The temperature of this water is about sixty-eight degrees, winter and summer, and is so clear that the bottom of the pool is easily seen at a depth of ten feet...A group of summer cottages had been erected on the high bluff overlooking the pool and the river. These houses are floored, screened, and equipped with electric lights and running water, affording the occupants all the pleasures of camping with none of it hardships. These camps are rented at reasonable rates.""

The ""Young Ladies' Basketball Team"" beat the ""Town Girls"" 7-4. The early women athletes did not, however, enjoy the enthusiastic support that today's Lady Longhorns receive. Even in 1916 the Cactus yearbook observed, ""Through some unaccountable agency, news at last managed to leak out that the Texas girls defeated the Southwestern basketball tossers by the close score of 24 to 22, how it all happened, only the select few will know.""</p>\n	</li>\n</ul>",,,,English,1701779232,,,

He stayed at the patient's side during this process, ate at the family table and slept there if the illness was dangerous.

353753,1,/ahc/road-ratification,The Road to Ratification,"<p>In late 1918, drained by the efforts to achieve primary suffrage, Texas suffragists opted to postpone proposals for a state constitutional amendment until after World War I. They chose instead to work for ratification of the federal amendment. This was in keeping with the National American Suffrage Association's philosophy, as passage of the federal amendm<img alt="""" src=""/library/u14401/quote_road.gif"" style=""height: 339px; width: 200px; float: right"" />ent was expected in January of 1919.</p>\n\n<p>The Texas Equal Suffrage Association formed a Ratification Committee, chaired by Jane Y. McCallum, in anticipation of the efforts necessary to lobby the Texas Legislature for ratification once the federal amendment was passed. Minnie Fisher Cunningham moved to Washington to labor for the national office by lobbying southern Democrats in the U.S. Senate.</p>\n\n<p>Prohibition arguments often overlapped with suffrage issues since most temperance leaders came to believe that woman suffrage would be the means by which to achieve their goals. Many of the Texas Equal Rights Association members were also members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Texas prohibitionists, needing the woman's vote, succeeded in pressing the suffragists to support an early state referendum on both prohibition and suffrage in 1919.</p>\n\n<p>Although the U.S. Senate failed to pass the federal amendment in January, Hobby signed the full suffrage bill on February 5, 1919. Suffragists launched an intensive campaign, but the May 24 election mandated by the suffrage bill resulted in the amendment's defeat. Election fraud and irregular election ballots were a major cause. Another important factor was the inclusion of a citizenship clause, passage of which would have stopped the custom of permitting aliens who had filed ""first papers""--an application for citizenship--to vote. In the election of May 24, ""first paper"" aliens were able to vote while women were not.</p>\n\n<p>On June 4, 1919, the U.S. Senate passed the federal suffrage amendment. By June 28th the Texas legislature had ratified the amendment, making Texas the ninth state in the nation, and the first in the South, to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter"">&lt;- <a href=""/ahc/primary-suffrage-texas-353750""><font color=""#000080"">PREVIOUS&nbsp;</font></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""/ahc/ratified-and-released-353754""><font color=""#000080"">NEXT</font></a>-&gt;</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter""><a href=""/ahc/jane-mccallumsuffrage-movement-353745""><font color=""#000080"">Austin Suffrage Association </font></a>| <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/early-years-353747""><font color=""#000080"">The Early Years</font></a> |<a href=""/ahc/primary-suffrage-texas-353750""> <font color=""#000080"">Primary Suffrage in Texas</font>&nbsp;</a>| <font color=""#"">Road to Ratification</font> | <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/ratified-and-released-353754""><font color=""#000080"">Ratified and Released</font></a></p>",,,,English,1701777298,,,
353750,1,/ahc/primary-suffrage-texas,Primary Suffrage in Texas,"<p>In Texas, the struggle for woman suffrage was carried out amidst the political turmoil of the Ferguson era. Governor James E. Ferguson, whom suffragists viewed as th<img alt="""" src=""/library/u14401/quote_primary.gif"" style=""height: 287px; width: 200px; float: right"" />e ""implacable foe of woman suffrage and of every great moral issue for which women stood,"" was inaugurated on January 12, 1915. After a bitter controversy involving Ferguson's efforts to control the University of Texas' faculty, finances, and Board of Regents, the Texas Senate voted to impeach Ferguson in September of 1917.</p>\n\n<p>In one-party states such as Texas, voters in primary elections essentially had a voice in the election of candidates. Primary suffrage was also easier to obtain, requiring simple majorities in the House and Senate and the approval of the governor. In contrast, full woman suffrage necessitated amending the state constitution, thereby requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of the state legislature, as well as voter approval.</p>\n\n<p>At its January 1918 board meeting the Texas Equal Suffrage Association took action. William P. Hobby, who had assumed the governorship upon Ferguson's departure, was asked to submit the primary suffrage bill at a special legislative session scheduled to convene February 26 to consider prohibition. In return, the group promised to ""use its influence and organization to assist him in his camp[aign] for Gov[ernor].""</p>\n\n<p>The primary suffrage bill, introduced by San Angelo representative Charles B. Metcalfe, passed both the House and Senate and was signed into law by Hobby on March 26, 1918. The law went into effect only seventeen days before the July 27th primary and a highly publicized registration drive that opened on June 26. In Travis County, 5,856 women were registered -- a number almost equal to the expected number of male voters</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter"">&lt;- <a href=""/ahc/early-years-353747"">PREVIOUS&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""/ahc/road-ratification-353753""><font color=""#000080"">NEXT</font></a>-&gt;</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter""><a href=""/ahc/jane-mccallumsuffrage-movement-353745"">Austin Suffrage Association </a>| <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/early-years-353747""><font color=""#000080"">The Early Years</font></a> | <font color=""#"">Primary Suffrage in Texas</font>&nbsp;| <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/road-ratification-353753""><font color=""#000080"">Road to Ratification</font></a> | <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/ratified-and-released-353754""><font color=""#000080"">Ratified and Released</font></a></p>",,,,English,1701778525,,,
353747,1,/ahc/early-years,The Early Years,"<p>The earliest organized effort for woman suffrage in Texas began in 1893 when Rebecca Henry Hayes of Galveston issued a call for a convention of interested men and women to meet in Dallas. The Texas Equal Rights Association was founded by the convention to ""advance the industrial, educational, and equal rights of women, and to secure suffrage to them by appropriate State and national legislation."" After a brief period of activity, however, the Association had ceased to exist by 1896.</p>\n\n<p>In 1903, Annette Finnigan and her sisters Elizabeth and Katherine, attempted to rekindle interest in the issue by organizing an equal suffrage league in Houston. Finnigan was elected president of the Texas Woman Suffrage Association at a convention held in Houston later that year. Although the group met again in 1904, the departure of the Finnigan sisters from Texas in 1905 initiated another period of inactivity.</p>\n\n<p>The next state convention was not held until 1913, when delegates meeting in San Antonio elected Eleanor Brackenridge, then in her seventies, state president. By 1914, Annette Finnigan had returned to Texas and was again at the helm of the state organization. She sent letters to all Texas legislators requesting their positions concerning the issue and urging them to submit ""the question of woman suffrage as a constitutional amendment to the voters.""</p>\n\n<p>By 1915, when Minnie Fisher Cunningham was elected president at Galveston, there were twenty-one local societies and 2500 individual members throughout Texas. The growing strength of the movement was evidenced by the endorsement of equal suffrage for women and by the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs in the same year. At the 1916 Dallas convention, the Association adopted a new constitution and emerged as the Texas Equal Suffrage Association (TESA). Under Cunningham's stewardship, the group grew to include ninety-eight local chapters, and in 1917, moved its headquarters from Houston to Austin to facilitate lobbying of the Texas legislature.</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter"">&nbsp;&lt;- <a href=""/ahc/jane-mccallumsuffrage-movement-353745"">PREVIOUS</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""/ahc/primary-suffrage-texas-353750""><font color=""#000080"">NEXT</font></a>-&gt;</p>\n\n<p class=""rtecenter""><a href=""/ahc/jane-mccallumsuffrage-movement-353745"">Austin Suffrage Association </a>|The Early Years| <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/primary-suffrage-texas-353750""><font color=""#000080"">Primary Suffrage in Texas</font></a>&nbsp;| <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/road-ratification-353753""><font color=""#000080"">Road to Ratification</font></a> | <a class=""suf"" href=""/ahc/ratified-and-released-353754""><font color=""#000080"">Ratified and Released</font></a></p>",,,,English,1701777365,,,

Henry)</a> was born on a plantation in Greensboro, North Carolina on September 11, 1862. In 1882, prompted by ill health, he moved to a ranch in West Texas. Two years later, he moved to Austin where he resided until 1898. During Porter's early years in the city, he held several jobs. He was a pharmacist at the Morley Drug Store, a bookkeeper for Joe Harrell, and later, a clerk at Maddox Brothers and Anderson, general land agents. As a bachelor, he enjoyed singing with the Hill City Quartet, known for serenading young women on the streets of Austin. The group also entertained at local weddings, church festivals, and picnics. Porter was a frequenter of the Bismark Saloon, his favorite ""watering hole"".</p>\n\n<p>In 1887, Porter eloped with seventeen year old Athol Estes, an Austin native, who was impressed with both his singing and drawing abilities. They were married at Flower Hill, the home of Reverend R. K. Smoot. Porter's status as the head of a new household motivated him to take a job at the Texas Land Office, where he translated his skills as a cartoonist into cartography. Porter's maps, some of which are embellished with topical sketches and landscapes, are still on file at the General Land Office in Austin.</p>\n\n<p>Will and Athol had two children, an infant son who died in 1888 and Margaret Worth Porter, born in 1889. Shortly after, Athol's health began to deteriorate from tuberculosis. Will pursued his interest in writing and illustrated a book, Indian Depredations in Texas, by J. W. Wilbarger. In 1891, Porter left his job at the Texas Land Office and moved on to become a bank teller at the First National Bank of Austin, earning $100 a month.</p>\n\n<p>The Rolling Stone, his 1894 venture in writing and publishing a newspaper, gained a healthy circulation of about 1000 in a city of 11,000. Despite public interest, Porter was unable to make a profit and stopped production after a year. Further disappointments ensued when discrepancies in his accounting at the bank amounted to over $4000, demanding his resignation. Porter removed himself to Houston where he wrote a column for the Houston Post. To avoid an embezzlement trial, he fled to New Orleans and embarked on a steamer to Honduras. In his desperate situation, he impulsively planned to wait out the statute of limitations in Central America, but he abandoned this plan when he got word that his wife was about to die. He returned to Austin to care for her and to await his trial. Shortly after his wife's death in 1897, William Porter was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to five years in the federal penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio and he never returned to Texas. After his release from prison, Porter moved briefly to Pittsburgh and then to New York City, where he established residency.</p>\n\n<p>While in prison, Will Porter adopted the pen name O. Henry and began his career as a short story writer. His work was prolific but began to decline, along with his health, after 1907. O. Henry died in New York City in 1910, prior to his forty-eighth birthday. His legacy continues in the O. Henry Award, one of the most prestigious short story prizes in America.</p>",,,,English,1711403067,,,

Henry, who lived in Austin, still using his given name of William Sydney Porter, from 1885 to 1894. The O. Henry Resources of the Austin History Center are comprised primarily of materials donated by Judge Trueman E. O'Quinn and augmented by items acquired from Jenny Lind Porter, Ethel Hofer, the Maddox family, the Austin Heritage Society, and the Austin History Center Association. These resources include original typescripts, first edition books, periodicals, correspondence, manuscripts, autograph albums, photographs, sketches, maps, paintings, and furniture.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 the AHC partnered with the Texas General Land Office and the State Preservation Board to create an online collection of O. Henry materials at the Portal to Texas History. Over 200 items were digitized, including 190 AHC items, and are available online. The collection includes photographs, original manuscript material, first printings of many of his short stories, and full text scans of some of his collected works.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=""http://texashistory.unt.edu/explore/partners/ASPL/browse/?fq=untl_collection%3AOHENRY"">Access and Search the O.

In the early morning hours prior to the UT attack, Whitman murdered his beloved mother and then his wife in cold blood. Another individual died years later of complications from a gunshot wound inflicted during the UT attack, bringing the total death toll to 17. At the time, this seemingly senseless massacre of civilians was unprecedented and considered the worst mass murder in modern U.S. history. The AHC’s new exhibit, “Looking Back: 50 Years After the UT Tower Shooting” seeks to better our understanding of this tragic event, both in the context of its time and impact locally, as well as how we can and should learn from the experience today as our country continues to experience a seeming epidemic of mass shootings on school campuses and other public areas. The exhibit opens July 26 and runs through November 20, 2016.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px"">August 1, 2016 marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the UT Tower shootings. It is also the day that Senate Bill 11, the concealed “campus carry” law goes into effect, allowing those with concealed handgun licenses to carry concealed handguns on public university campuses across the state of Texas. According to the FBI, mass shootings are on the rise in the United States. In 2015 alone, there were 372 such shootings, 64 of which took place on school campuses. As recently as June 12, 2016, the worst mass murder in our nation’s history in a public space as well as the deadliest terror attack since 9/11 occurred in an Orlando, Florida nightclub when a gunman armed with semi-automatic weaponry took the lives of 49 innocent people and wounded at least 53 others.&nbsp; Given these sobering statistics, this exhibit asks the viewer to explore what the UT Tower shooting means for us today as a society. Was this tragedy and others like it preventable? What role does mental health play in such tragedies? What about gun legislation or its inconsistency across states?&nbsp; By preserving the memory of this horrific event, it is our hope that we as a people can better understand why it happened in the first place in order to prevent more tragedies like this one from happening in the future.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px"">The exhibit draws heavily on the records of the Austin Police Department’s (APD) Charles Whitman mass murder investigation, which came to the Austin History Center in 2000 and 2002. Since that time, materials from this collection (AR.2000.002) have been among the most frequently requested and cited in the Austin History Center’s Archives and Manuscripts Collection. The vast majority of the collection is comprised of reports filed by APD along with work done by local, state, and federal agencies working in conjunction with APD such as the Texas State Department of Public Safety, Travis County, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&nbsp; A smaller yet highly significant portion of this collection includes the diaries, writings, photographs, and personal effects belonging to Charles J. Whitman. Gathered during the investigation as evidence, they have since been used by researchers worldwide and those affected by the tragedy to try to make sense of this senseless act of violence.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px"">Click the thumbnail images below to view more from the exhibit.

Today the exhibits program has grown from an ancillary aspect of the AHC to part of its core services. But exhibits in an archive present particular challenges.&nbsp; Unlike a museum that specializes in collecting three-dimensional artifacts, most of the materials come in a more two-dimensional format – letters and papers and photographs. Yet this difference can also be a great strength. Because these are primary sources, they allow for a greater degree of detail and precision in telling a historical narrative. Also, depending upon the interests of the researcher, the kinds of information that can be extracted from historical documents is virtually endless. From these primary sources a researcher can truly get into the nitty-gritty of history, and our exhibits over the past nine years have sought to bring forward this aspect of our local history. If you have never visited us before, we hope this taste of our past exhibits inspires you to return. And for those who have become familiar with some of the exhibits we’ve mounted already, we hope this sampling reminds you of how incredibly interesting and nuanced local history can be.</span></p>\n			</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px"">Click the thumbnail images below to view more from the exhibit.

346540,1,/ahc/neal-douglass-photograph-archive,Neal Douglass Photograph Archive,"<p>Neal A. Douglass, Jr. was a news and commercial photographer based in Austin, Texas, active from the late 1930s through the 1960s. He was the first staff photographer for the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, originally hired as a journalist but sent to a crash course in photography in 1935 in order to learn the trade. Because the <em>Statesman </em>did not have a darkroom facility, Douglass developed his negatives in his home kitchen with the help of his wife Elnora. Eventually the newspaper's photography staff grew; other photographers working under Douglass included Nolan Borden, Pat Cahill, Ray Child, Harold Gully, Julian Hovey, Bill Malone, Bill Monroe, Charlie Neal, Mike Olive, and Mrs. Joe Jacks who coordinated darkroom activity.</p>\n\n<p>Douglass made an arrangement with the paper that would allow him to run his own commercial photography business alongside the photojournalism work he did for the paper. So in addition to news stories, he would photograph weddings, anniversaries, family reunions, politicians, buildings, car accidents, and other commercial subjects. In 1942, after the U.S. had entered World War II, he volunteered to serve in the Signal Corps of the 7th Service Command. He worked as a photographer, stationed at the Santa Fe building in Dallas. Elnora ran their photography business in Austin while he was away until 1943. After the war he returned to his photography business. He officially left the Statesman in 1954.</p>\n\n<p>The Neal Douglass Photograph Archive was donated to the AHC by his family in 2005.

Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center</h2>\n\n<p>In the early 1970s at the height of the Chicano Movement in Austin, Texas, Mexican American and Latino artists, educators, and leaders recognized a need for cultural arts space, education, and programming. With members from such organizations as the League of United Chicano Artists (LUChA) in East Austin, a myriad of Latino dance arts groups, Chicano theater troupes, and community organizations, this idea gained momentum. The eventual demise of El Centro Chicano and the Juárez-Lincoln Center created an urgent need for a community cultural center, and Austin’s artists and community leaders were eager to pursue that goal. After many long years and struggles, ground broke for the Mexican American Cultural Center (MACC) in 2005, and, at last, the grand opening was held September 15, 2007, realizing a nearly 40 year old dream for the Mexican American community in Austin. In 2011, the center was renamed the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center (ESB-MACC).</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>About the Oral History Project</h2>\n\n<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">A goal of this oral history project was to document and honor many of the individuals who played a significant role in the decades-long struggle leading to the creation of the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center (ESB-MACC), while also exploring the growth and obstacles experienced throughout the process. Included in this collection are the preserved oral histories of 28 stakeholders, including transcripts, audio and some video. The archival collection (AR.2015.012) also includes newspaper articles, newsletters, and event flyers.</span></p>\n\n<p>Link to the full online finding aid is on TARO:&nbsp;http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aushc/00502/ahc-00502.html</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=""line-height: 1.2;"">Listen to clips of the oral history interviews here</span><span style=""line-height: 1.2;"">:</span></p>\n\n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""304"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/189772724&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"" width=""540""></iframe></p>\n\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<h5><img alt=""[Gus Garcia], AR.2010.016, Mexican American Firsts: Trailblazers of Austin and Travis County Exhibit Collection"" src=""/library/u8043/gus_garcia_resized.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 239px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; float: left;"" /></h5>\n\n<p><strong style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Gustavo ‘Gus’ Garcia</strong><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">, Interviewed by Paul Saldaña on September 14, 2012.

Social clubs for women existed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but toward the end of the century an increasing number of women’s groups began to form with political leanings. Various organizations have helped raise awareness about women’s rights issues, educate voters, lobby legislative bodies, and support women running for office. Some groups dissolved after their particular causes were no longer relevant, while other groups have been longer lasting. Political groups for women continue to play a role in politics today.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=""font-size:28px;""><span class=""style-casual"" style=""color: rgb(98, 13, 13);"">Women's Christian Temperance Union</span></span></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Formed at a national level in 1873, local chapters of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in Texas began forming in 1881. The group’s agenda focused on total abstinence from alcohol and a Christian life. It also promoted social welfare reform related to issues such as prostitution, sanitation, and prisons. In 1888 the organization promoted woman suffrage, believing that women voters would support the goal of prohibition. When the Texas Equal Rights Association formed in 1893 many of their members also belonged to the WCTU. In the 1920s, the WCTU formed part of the Joint Legislative Council, but after the end of Prohibition the group’s membership began to decline. The last president in Texas died in 1978.</span></p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""1"" cellspacing=""1"" style=""width: 940px;"">\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td style=""width: 448px; vertical-align: top;"">\n			<h2 class=""rtecenter"">&nbsp;</h2>\n\n			<h2 class=""rtecenter""><span style=""font-size:28px;""><span class=""style-casual"" style=""color: rgb(28, 24, 60);"">Texas Federation of Women’s Clubs</span></span></h2>\n\n			<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">The Texas Federation of Women’s Clubs grew out of local literary clubs which unified in 1897 to promote literary study and establish public libraries.

For the next few decades, the group was very much an activist organization, influencing legislation on child labor, juvenile courts, maternal health, public education, and women’s property rights, among many other things. The group still exists and focuses on helping women better themselves, their families, and their communities. “The Fed,” as its headquarters is known, is located on San Gabriel Street in Austin.</span></p>\n			</td>\n			<td style=""width: 10px;"">&nbsp;</td>\n			<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">\n			<p><img alt=""C07960"" src=""/library/u361/C07960-frame.jpg"" style=""width: 450px; height: 371px;"" /></p>\n\n			<p><span style=""font-size:10px;"">[Group portrait of TFWC members in front of their headquarters], circa 1920s-1930s, C07960, Chalberg Collection of Prints and Negatives</span></p>\n			</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""1"" cellspacing=""1"" style=""width: 940px;"">\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">\n			<p><img alt=""AS-59-22268-01"" src=""/library/u361/AS-59-22268-01-frame.jpg"" style=""width: 450px; height: 349px;"" /></p>\n\n			<p><span style=""font-size:10px;"">League of Women Voters as lobbyists, March 17, 1959, AS-59-22268-01, <em>Austin American-Statesman </em>Negative Collection.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span style=""font-size:10px;"">Members of the League of Women Voters of Texas pass out informational materials to other women.

Active with the Joint Legislative Council, the grouped helped lobby for a minimum wage for women, to allow women to serve on juries, to get more women on delegations to national party conventions, and on other social issues. The League continues to be active and follows a mission of encouraging informed participation in government and influencing public policy through education and advocacy.

They lobbied the Legislature on such issues as school funding, stricter prohibition laws, mother-infant health programs, and prison reform, and helped establish a state board of education. The group also helped get 32 women appointed to state boards, four women elected to the Texas House, and the first woman elected to the state Senate before disbanding in 1930.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""1"" cellspacing=""1"" style=""width: 925px;"">\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">\n			<p><img alt=""PICA 07117"" src=""/library/u361/PICA-07117-frame.jpg"" style=""width: 450px; height: 323px;"" /></p>\n\n			<p><span style=""font-size:10px;"">[University Women’s Political Caucus], Circa 1970s, PICA 07117.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span style=""font-size:10px;"">Dotty Griffith of the University Women’s Political Caucus hands out informational materials to Carol Bennett of Austin and Margaret Carter of Fort Worth.</span></p>\n			</td>\n			<td style=""width: 10px;"">&nbsp;</td>\n			<td style=""width: 447px; vertical-align: top;"">\n			<h2 class=""rtecenter"">&nbsp;</h2>\n\n			<h2 class=""rtecenter""><span style=""font-size:28px;""><span class=""style-casual"" style=""color: rgb(98, 13, 13);"">Texas Women’s Political Caucus</span></span></h2>\n\n			<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">The National Women’s Political Caucus formed in 1971 along with Texas and Austin chapters. Texan writer and activist Liz Carpenter co-founded the group and gave the keynote address at the national convention. The goal of the organization was to help get more women of any party into politics, whether in elected or appointed office, as delegates to party conventions, as judges, as lobbyists, or as voters. The group also focused on getting the Equal Rights Amendment passed. The local organization’s work met with early success: six women were elected to the Texas Legislature in 1972 and Texas ratified the ERA in 1973. Later the group helped elect Austin Mayor Carole Keeton McClellan and supported Ann Richards’ campaign for governor. Their headquarters remain in Austin.</span></p>\n			</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=""font-size:28px;""><span class=""style-casual"" style=""color: rgb(28, 24, 60);"">Hispanic Women’s Network of Texas</span></span></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">The Hispanic Women’s Network of Texas was founded in 1986 in order to promote the participation of Hispanic women in public, corporate, and civic life. Martha Hinojosa-Nadler, State Representative Lena Guerrero and Travis County Voter Registrar Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza brainstormed the idea for the group. They pulled together a steering committee which then organized a conference in Dallas in 1987 where 200 Hispanic women from across the state converged to discuss Latina issues. The organization focused on political appointments, voter registration drives, and lobbying the Legislature. Today the organization provides professional development opportunities, has a scholarship fund, and holds annual conferences.

She opened her own practice and then teamed up with Dallas lawyer Linda Coffee to work on the case <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, which argued for a woman’s right to have an abortion. Weddington argued the case successfully before the U.S. Supreme court in 1971 and 1972. During this time she also lobbied the Texas Legislature to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and helped found the Texas Women’s Political Caucus.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">She decided that the best way to pass laws on women’s issues would be to become a legislator herself. In 1972, political activist Ann Richards managed Weddington’s successful campaign, and she became the first woman to represent Austin and Travis County in the Texas House. While in office Weddington worked to pass many laws related to women’s rights. She worked on bills allowing women to get credit in their own name, to prevent pregnant teachers from being fired, and to provide compensation to rape victims, and she fought anti-abortion legislation. She also co-sponsored the Kidney Health Bill, supported increased benefits for public employees, and supported funding for the arts. In 1975 <em>Texas Monthly</em> named her one of the ten best legislators in the state.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">In 1977 President Carter appointed Weddington as general counsel to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

She ran for a position on the Austin Independent School District Board of Trustees in 1968, winning just three days after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination, and becoming the first African American on the board. Her presence on the board helped speed up the desegregation process.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Wanting to have a wider impact on her community, she won a seat in the Texas House of Representatives in 1974, becoming the first African American to represent Travis County.

The first in her family to attend college, she graduated from the University of Texas in 1936 with a bachelor’s degree in history and government. While there she met Stuart Long who soon became her husband. After World War II Stuart started Long News Service at the Capitol.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Long was first elected to City Council in 1948. She served until 1969, during which time she won nine elections, lost two and sat out one. During her tenure she worked to improve parks and libraries, to modernize streets by getting them paved, to make phone and utility service more affordable, and to create better working conditions for public employees. She also supported civil rights by advocating for the integration of libraries, playgrounds and swimming pools and by pushing an ordinance prohibiting racial discrimination in housing sales.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">She was very well liked by the public because of her actions that benefited citizens; the business community, however, did not like her progressivism quite as much. It was her candidacy that prompted a change in the City Council election system. Previously, the top five candidates won seats on Council, but in 1953 the charter was changed to a place system. Thus Long would have to run for a specific seat against a specific opponent (who was backed by the business community), which would make it harder for her to win. Despite the changes to the system, Long won six more elections.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Long was active in many organizations, including the League of Women Voters, the Federated Business and Professional Women’s Club, the American Association of University Women, the American Legion Auxiliary, and the Texas Democratic Party.

In 1975 she was elected to her only term on City Council.

While in office, she remained devoted to improving neighborhoods. A major initiative during her tenure was to create the “Capitol-views corridors” to prevent views of the Capitol building from being marred.

As State Librarian, she worked to expand services beyond historical work to providing support for libraries across the state. Under her leadership, new libraries were founded in several counties. She also initiated services for the blind in the state library. In 1924, when “Ma” Ferguson was elected governor, West resigned her position and went to work as head librarian at Texas Technical College where she worked until her retirement in 1942.

After 28 years as deputy and working under four Clerks, she decided to run for Clerk herself. She was elected as County Clerk in 1934, becoming the first woman in the position.

She left the field, though, because of the inequity in pay which turned her into a “suffragette.”</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">She was a founding member and president of the Galveston Equal Suffrage Association in 1912 and in 1915 became president of the Texas Equal Suffrage Association.

She promised prohibitionist legislators that if they supported primary woman suffrage, women would then vote to support “dry” legislators and William Hobby for governor. Hobby did not outright support woman suffrage, afraid it would cost him votes (he would soon be up for re-election). Suffragists gathered a petition of signatures from legislators promising a majority vote for suffrage in both houses should a bill be introduced. Representative Charles Metcalfe then introduced a primary suffrage bill, it passed by a large majority, and Governor Hobby signed it into law on March 26, 1918. Those women able to vote in the primary in turn helped to re-elect Hobby as Governor in a landslide.</span></p>\n\n			<p><span class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">In 1927 Cunningham became the first woman in Texas to run for the U.S. Senate.

The first people to settle and build this city had to be made of sterner stuff, including women. Named as the Republic of Texas’ capital city in 1839, Austin has long been a political city. But women were not welcome to participate in politics. If women had political opinions, those ideas had to be expressed through their husbands.</p>\n\n			<p class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Since those early days, though, Austin has had outspoken female residents who voiced their political leanings despite not being able to vote or hold office. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Austin was home to many ardent suffragists, but it was a longer struggle to get women into elected office. Not until mid-century did Austin have its first city councilwoman. It was not until the 1970s that Travis County had female legislators or Austin its first woman mayor. It was only in 1990 that Texas had its first female governor elected in her own right, not as a package deal with her husband.</p>\n\n			<p class=""poor-rich"" style=""font-size:18px;"">Though women serving in politics is more commonplace today, the efforts of many brave women over the course of about 150 years helped Austin to become a city where female politicians are accepted.

""Uncle Billy"" Barton bought the land around the springs in 1837, just before Austin was founded as the capital of the Republic of Texas. The two major springs were named after Barton's daughters Parthenia and Eliza. Although widely popular as a public swimming hole, campground, and picnic site during the late 1800s, it was 1918 before the springs came under public ownership, when Andrew Zilker donated the land around the springs to the Austin school district, which in turn sold the land to the City of Austin for public park land.</p>\n\n<p>The city enlarged the pool and built the surrounding sidewalks in the 1920s, creating ""the finest municipal resort in the entire southwest.""
